## The History Timeline Studio Project

Given the enormously powerful way in which traditional history timelines 
convey information, why are they not more prevalent?  Almost certainly. it's
because of the difficulty of creating them. Happily, we now have computers to
do all the hard work so all that's needed is some programmer to sit down and
make it easy to specify the contents of a timeline.

Actually there's a bit of intellectual work which precedes the programming
because we don't have any commonly-understood visual language for timelines.
As a result, each timeline author has made up his own, just as I did when
creating the two sample timelines for the Harvard College course in the
Hebrew Bible in 2013.
