## The History Timeline Studio Project

Given the enormously powerful way in which traditional history timelines 
convey information, why are they not more prevalent?  Almost certainly, it's
because of the difficulty of creating them. Happily, we now have computers to
do all the hard work so all that's needed is some programmer to sit down and
make it easy to specify the contents of a timeline.

Actually there's a bit of intellectual work which precedes the programming
because we don't have any commonly-understood visual language for timelines.
As a result, each timeline author has had make up his own, just as I did when
creating the two sample timelines for the Harvard College course in the
Hebrew Bible in 2013.

Let's look at those timelines to examine their visual language. (Each of the
timelines is interactive in the sense that hovering over an element brings
up additional information. To experience the interactivity, you need to display
the timeline on it's own web page.)

Below is a static version of the 
[Overview timeline](ruml.com/thehebrewbible/timelines/overview.html) which focuses
on what might be called the "background contexts" during the period covered and the
events which led to each following context. I call these contexts "eras" although
"perod" is a typical usage among historians. A typical use for the era on a timeline
would be to denote a war, a reign, or the economic context as in the Great Depression.
