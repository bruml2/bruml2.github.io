## B Ruml's computing experience

I discovered computing late in life.  I was 29 in 1972 and working for the Legal 
Services branch of the Equal Opportunity Commission in Washington when I was
assigned to evaluate a grant which had been made to a lawyer and computer
science professor in Madison, WI.  The proposed to program a minicomputer
to interview legal services clients who were seeking uncontested divorces
to obtain the personal information required to fill out the complaint and
associated papers. The state-of-the-art meant that the computer terminal 
would be operated by a paralegal but the time saved in automatically
preparing the papers and having a digital record of the information  was
very significant.
