	<h1>Hi there, I'm "B" Ruml!</h1>
	<p>I'm retired after 40+ years of programming. My long-time personal project is
		an open source application which makes it easy to create history timelines like these:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://ruml.com/thehebrewbible/timelines/overview.html">An overview of
			the history behind the Hebrew Bible</a> (created for a course at Harvard
			College);
		 </li>
		<li><a href="http://ruml.com/thehebrewbible/timelines/ideasBasic.html">An overview of 
			ideas during the biblical period</a> (created for the same course);
		 </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
