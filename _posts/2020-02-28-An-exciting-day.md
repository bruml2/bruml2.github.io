Attended my first Vue.js Meetup downtown last night and had the very good
fortune to meet Deepak Penmetsa, a deeply experienced Vue/Vuetify developer,
who is willing to help me on the History Timeline Studio project when I get
stuck.

This morning, more good luck checking out a repo for a vue/d3 application
suggested by the Meetup host.  That repo contained a deploy.sh file automating
the building and deploying of the app.  The deploying was done to a Github Pages
site, something that was new to me.  So I've been at work learning about Github
Pages with this site as first fruits. (It's also giving me a chance to become
familiar with Jekyll, a static site generator integrated into Githu Pages.)

Further goals for the day:

- update my ruml.com home page

- put a prev button on the tabs

- continue cleaning things up for Deepak
